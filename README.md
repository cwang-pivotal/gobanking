# Go Banking interview

One canned-interview to rule them all...

## Instructions for interviewers

1. Copy and paste into terminal
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:dugancathal/gobanking.git
  cd gobanking
  . bin/setup go react
  ```

1. Import stories.csv to tracker
1. Select a story and get crackin'

### A note on structure

At the top-level, there's a directory for the GOPATH that serves as the backend,
a directory for the API Gateway in Rails, and a directory for each JS frontend.

All of the stories are oriented toward a horizontal slice of the application (frontend, backend).
If a vertical orientation is desired, write a story.
